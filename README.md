DuneCatalog
===========
A MediaMonkey Script that creates a Music Index for the Dune Media Streamer.


Summary
=======
On the Dune Streamer a Media Index can be created by a system of folders and files.
Even for a small number of files, it is a lot of work to create and maintain such
an index. Various applications have been created for Video (yaDIS, Zappiti, etc.).
For Music only Dune Music Library (promising, but not finished) and Musicnizer
(not free) exist.

This script uses an existing MediaMonkey library and creates a simple Music Index.
The Menu can be searched by: Album, Artist And Year. Below these are subfolders
to make the catalog manageable and finding music easy and quick.

The Index is created with the Android App DMC in mind. DMC can read the Dune Index
folder and present the same menu on your phone/tablet. This means, it is possible
to navigate through your music without having the TV on and without pointing your
remote to the TV (as it works with wifi).

This is my first script in MediaMonkey. I wanted a simple Menu Index, which it is,
and it works very well for me. If you are looking for a more extensive index,
try Dune Music Library or Musicnizer. I'd thought to share it at this moment. Use it,
like it, change it, it's yours.
