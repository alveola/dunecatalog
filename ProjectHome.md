This Script creates a Music Index for use with a HDI Dune Media Player. It uses the MM Library and to create menu that has three main entries: Albums, Artists and Years. Through this menu, it is easy and quick to browse to your album and play it on the Dune.

The menu that is created is developed with the Android App DMC in mind. This App can display any Dune Indexes that exist on the same network. Now you can browse your Music Index without having to switch the TV on.

See the [Manual](Manual.md) for more info. The MediaIndex shows some screenshots and the differences between TV and Android DMC App.
